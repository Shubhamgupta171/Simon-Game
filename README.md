## Description

Simon is a memory game where players have to repeat a sequence of colors. This project is a digital version of the classic Simon game.

The game ends when the player makes a mistake in mimicking the sequence.

## Features

- Randomly generated sequences of colors for each level.
- Flashing buttons to indicate the sequence to the player.
- Interactive buttons for the player to click and mimic the sequence.
- Level tracking to indicate the player's progress.
